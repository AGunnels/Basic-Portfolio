    <p>Thank you for visiting my contact page to get to know a little bit aobut me. I am a driven individual who strives
        to find, keep, and cherish the happiness in life. Goals are a huge part of my daily routine. Family and friends +
        these goals keep my heart beating and my motivations high. I would love to continue to create sweet pages like this 
        for all to see after graduating from CWRU in July-- truth be told, graduation is almost August. This really cuts into
        my summer play time. But I will be patient and so should you, because the best is yet to come. 
        Please continue to learn more about my (a complete stranger to you-- so you are probably a little weird) interests of 
        computers, sports, music, cooking, and the great outdoors. It is all included in the portfolio section of the 
        application....get ready to have you mind blown and your socks blown off!  
    </p>
